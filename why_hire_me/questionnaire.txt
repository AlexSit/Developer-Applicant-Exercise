What are your opinions on Agile software development?
It is a great practice and methodology that allowed software developers and their clients to move from a one-directional
work style to an ever evolving close collaboration that ensures that the right software is build in the most efficient manner
with customer needs in mind. I enjoy practicing it and I think that the beauty of it is that teams can customize the framework
for themselves.

TDD or BDD?
