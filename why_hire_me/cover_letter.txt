Hello Sir/Madam,

My name is Alexander Sitnikov (also go by Sasha).
It is my pleasure to apply for the position of Software Engineer at Hedgeye.
I am an experienced programmer with multi-stack expertise; I consider myself a generalist with specialism in back-end.
I have a proven record of learning new technology quickly and I have worked remotely before.
Althought Ruby is not my main programming language , I believe all necessary skills to master it quickly to benefit the company.
I am capable of making independent decisions while taking customers' needs into account and working closely with my team.
I have worked on scalable solutions and maintaining a clean, well-designed and well-tested codebase is my passion.

Thank you for your attention.

Best,
Alexander
